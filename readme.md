# Welcome to the Pokimon Project!

This project is a dynamic exploration of the fascinating world of Pokémon, built using Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript.

## Overview

In this project, we delve into the intricate details of Pokémon, featuring four main tables:

1. **Pokémon**: Discover information about various Pokémon species.
2. **Trainer**: Learn about the trainers who embark on exciting journeys with their Pokémon companions.
3. **Ability**: Explore the unique abilities possessed by different Pokémon.
4. **Type**: Understand the elemental types that shape Pokémon battles.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with schema.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other advanced features.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation tool.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server.
